## Bookshelf

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| Your First Year in Code | Advice from experienced programmers for getting through the initial stages of your development career. |
| Grokking Algorithms An Illustrated Guide For Programmers and Other Curious People | An interesting, illustrated guide to some fundamental algorithms and algorithmic concepts. |
| Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability | Common-sense guidance for web usability. |
| Practical Object-Oriented Design: An Agile Primer Using Ruby | Shows how the SOLID principles apply in practice in Ruby, as well as: how to manage dependencies with dependency injection; when to use classical inheritance vs modules vs composition/aggregation; how to implement common interfaces across multiple classes (duck typing); and how to design cost-effective tests. |
| Realâ€“World Software Development: A Project-Driven Guide to Fundamentals in Java | A highly valuable resource for a recent bootcamp grad and new Java developer (myself). Gives a high-level overview of various principles, patterns and practices that make for good software. The project-based approach, building a semi-realistic application, shows how each topic applies in practice. Although each topic isn't covered in deep detail, there is enough to build a working knowledge and to stimulate further research. Mostly applicable to any object-oriented language, but probably best if you're working in Java. |
| Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja | _in progress_ |
